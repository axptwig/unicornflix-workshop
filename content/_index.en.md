Welcome to UnicornFlix. As the first developer here at UnicornFlix it's your mission to bring humanity closer to the unicorn kingdom by serving up premium videos to subscribers. You've been asked by the founders to develop a minimum-lovable-product to begin serving videos to users as soon as possible. They've also asked you to keep operational overhead at a minimum and to keep the API design flexible as the business model could pivot at any moment.

In this workshop we will build the video on demand streaming platform that allows you to upload, process, and serve videos to authenticated users.

The workshop is split into three primary sections with a collection of optional extensions:

**Backend Deployment with Amplify CLI** - Use the Amplify CLI to deploy the API, Authentication, and Video Streaming infrastructure.

**Web Client Admin View** - Build a web application to add videos and associate basic metadata.

**Web Client User View** - Stream videos to users who have signed into the service.

**Optional Extensions** - An optional section containing a collection of tutorials to extend the application functionality.
