## Choose Your Own Adventure

Congratulations on building UnicornFlix! With the base application complete with video processing, a GraphQL API for serving URLs, and authentication, it's time to choose which features you'd like to add to delight your audience.

- [Amplify Hosting](./extensions/hosting.html) - Publish your web application through the Amplify Console and upload your own videos to UnicornFlix. After completing this exension, you'll be able to upload videos from your mobile device and ask your friends and family to provide their own.

- [Amplify Analytics](./extensions/analytics.html) - Start capturing metrics on UnicornFlix usage. This extension uses AWS Pinpoint to gather clickstream data from the app and help us make informed decisions about what type of content is resonating with our viewers or how the audience is using UnicornFlix.

- [Custom Metadata](./extensions/custom-metadata.html) - Viewers want more information on content they watch on UnicornFlix. This extension walks you through adding additional fields to the API so that admin users can supply more information on upload that is stored and presented to users on UnicornFlix.
